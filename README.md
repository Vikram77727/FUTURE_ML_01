📊 Sales Forecasting Dashboard  
This initiative was developed as a key part of my Machine Learning Internship with Future Interns. The core goal was to predict future sales trends and construct an interactive dashboard to deliver crucial business insights.  

🚀 Project Overview  
A robust time series forecasting model was created using Facebook Prophet.  
The findings and key performance indicators were visualized using Power BI.  
I conducted an analysis of historical trends to accurately predict future sales performance.  
The model's accuracy was assessed using standard metrics: MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.  
📂 Features  
✅ Forecasted daily sales with clear confidence intervals  

✅ Visual comparison of actual sales versus predicted sales trends

✅ Dedicated KPI cards to display actual and forecasted sales figures  

✅ Detailed error analysis through residual plotting  

✅ Insights broken down by product category  

✅ User-friendly, interactive dashboard filters
