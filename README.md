# 📊 Superstore Sales Forecasting Dashboard  

This project was developed during my **Machine Learning Internship** as a practical application of **time series forecasting**. The objective was to analyze past sales data, build a forecasting model, and design an **interactive dashboard** to support data-driven business decisions.  

---

## 🚀 Project Highlights  
- Built a **time series forecasting pipeline** using **Facebook Prophet** to estimate future sales.  
- Created an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to visualize both historical data and forecast results.  
- Engineered custom time-based features (month, quarter, holiday spikes) to improve model accuracy.  
- Evaluated model performance using **MAE, RMSE, and MAPE**.

## 📂 Key Features  
✅ Daily sales forecasts with confidence intervals  

✅ Comparison of actual sales vs. predicted trends  

✅ KPI cards for key forecast metrics  

✅ Exported clean CSV files (ready for BI tools):  
- `historical_daily_sales.csv`  
- `historical_and_forecast_sales.csv`  
- `future_forecasted_sales.csv`  
- `forecast_metrics.csv`  

✅ Interactive filters for deeper insights by time and category

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python** → Pandas, NumPy, Prophet, scikit-learn  
- **Google Colab** → Model training & CSV export  
- **Power BI Desktop** → Dashboard creation  

---

## 📈 Model Performance (sample run)  
- **MAE:** ~1.1  
- **RMSE:** ~1.3  
- **MAPE:** ~19%
